StaffSecure By Harry5573

What it does?

It gives you the option to make your staff choose a username/password when they login. But does not make players have one. This can prevent staff accounts from being hacked etc.

If you want a player to have to set a password give them the following permission:
- staffsecure.staff

Installation:
1) Download the securestaff.jar from bukkit
2) Drag it into your servers plugins folder
3) Reload/Restart your server
4) Give the players you want to have to login the permission
5) DONE! :)

Commands:
/password <pass>
/login <pass>

Please NOTE:
If your player does not have a password set they must have one!
